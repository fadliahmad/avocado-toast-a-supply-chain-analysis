This is a project that provide by Datacamp. What's in an Avocado Toast: A Supply Chain Analysis? 

You're in London, making an avocado toast, a quick-to-make dish that has soared in popularity on breakfast menus since the 2010s. A simple smashed avocado toast can be made with five ingredients: one ripe avocado, half a lemon, a big pinch of salt flakes, two slices of sourdough bread and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. It's no small feat that most of these ingredients are readily available in grocery stores. 

In this project, you'll conduct a supply chain analysis of three of these ingredients used in an avocado toast, utilizing the Open Food Facts database. This database contains extensive, openly-sourced information on various foods, including their origins. Through this analysis, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complex supply chain involved in producing a single dish.
